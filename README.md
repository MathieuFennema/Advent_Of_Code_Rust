# Advent_Of_Code_Rust
Hello there beautiful person reading this,

This is my Advent of Code in Rust. This is a learning assisgnment to myself to explore Rust.
So this code is not refactored, not beautifully designed, and not clean.
Please be carefull copying this work because there might be better ways of solving these problems.

Some solutions have been overly engineered to implement a design patterns.
Most solutions are hacked together quickly because I like to explore & solve problems.

To developers: Please be aware that there are better implementations.

To hiring people: I won't deliver code like this in a professional setting. I wouldn't even in my personal bigger projects.


Have a great day, and keep learning!
